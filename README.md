# surfs_up
## Overview
-	The purpose of this analysis was to learn the temperatures in Oahu, for the months of June and December, to see if a surf shop there will be sustainable year-round. 
##Results
-	While the mean temperature in June (74.94 degrees Fahrenheit) is higher than the mean temperature in December (71.04 degrees Fahrenheit), they are not far enough from each other to constitute a major difference. 
-	There is a larger number of temperatures recorded in June (1700) than in December (1517).
-	The range of temperatures is less in June (with a difference of 21 degrees between max and min temperatures) than in December(with a difference of 27 degrees between max and min temperatures). 
##Summary
-	Overall, it does seem suitable for a surf shop to be present year-round as there are many similarities between temperatures in June and December. 
-	Two additional analyses that could be performed include analyzing data in March and September, and comparing standard deviations and median points across these months as well.
